# Prepare the single-ancestry meta-analysis results for trans-ancestry
# meta-analysis with MANTRA:
#
# ??? = bash wildcard to match all of AFR/EAS/EUR/LAT directories
# SEX = full, male, or female

Rscript pre_tama_merge.R results/meta_results/???/SEX/*meta_SEX1_pretama.tsv

# Above script will:
# - merge the single-ancestry meta-analysis results so that it's ready for TAMA
#   using MANTRA
# - align the effect alleles so it's consistent across ancestries

# MANTRA requires the input files to be in a specific way, so arrange the
# output from above script so it can be used for MANTRA:
bash pre_tama_arrange.sh data/tama_dat/SEX/SEX_merged_dat.tsv

# This script generates the "distance" between the ancestries (using the
# `dmatcal` script from MANTRA) and tar the input files for running MANTRA on
# HPC platform
bash prep_tama.sh SEX

# This script/note contains the general procedure of running MANTRA using the
# data created from the above scripts.
#
# The general steps are:
# - split the files into smaller chunks (~5000 SNPs)
# - run MANTRA in parallel, using the chunked files and other input files (e.g.
#   info from `dmatcal`)
# - merge the chunked results together at the end

# Calculate N, merge and clean TAMA results, and plot

# Very simple awk to generate the N used for each variant (MANTRA can only
# output sample size less than 6 digits long, so need to manually calculate it)
awk -f calc_tama_n.awk data/tama_dat/SEX/SEX_merged_dat.tsv > results/tama_results/SEX/tama_sample_size.txt

# Clean up the MANTRA output:
#
# This script will:
# - add correct sample size for the variants that had more than 6 digits
# - Add header to the TAMA results
# - keep only the variants that had information from all four ancestries
# - get rsID using SNPtracker and add it to the summary stats
# - merge all of the info together (TAMA results, per-ancestry beta, and rsID)
bash clean_tama_results.sh results/tama_results/SEX/comb.out

# Rename the cleaned results to "tama_SEX_clean.out"
rename comb tama_SEX results/tama_results/SEX/comb*

# Filter out variants that didn't pass the N threshold in the single-ancestry
# GWAS:
#
# Note that a variant could still be present in all 4 ancestries when TAMA is
# run, since N-filtering was done after the meta-analyses (hence the filtering
# is done separately now)

# Combine all of the variants that passed in each ancestry and pull out those
# that were present in all 4 ancestries (i.e. those that passed the N-filter in
# all 4 ancestries):
