# Self-explanatory - runs METAL using the METAL script that it specifies

# Clean up single-ancestry meta-analysis results:
#
# ANC = ancestry (AFR/EUR/EAS/LAT) - where the summary stats are located
# SEX = full, male, or female
bash clean_metal.sh results/meta_results/ANC/SEX/ANC_meta_SEX1.tbl

# Above script will:
# - make extra columns for CHR and POS
# - uppercase the alleles
# - remove markers with significant HetISq
# - generate a copy of the results with only the columns required for TAMA (ID,
#   chr, pos, MAF, beta, se, alleles, sample size).
# - reorder the summary stats based on chr/pos

# rsID for the variants were added using SNPtracker
bash snptrack.sh results/meta_results/ANC/SEX/ANC_meta_SEX1_clean.tsv
Rscript merge_rsID.R results/meta_results/ANC/SEX/ANC_meta_SEX1_clean.tsv results/meta_results/ANC/SEX/ANC_meta_SEX1_clean.result.txt

# Remove variants that didn't pass the study size and/or sample size threshold:
bash nfilter.sh results/meta_results/ANC/SEX/ANC_meta_SEX1_clean_rsid.txt

# For the N-filter threshold, if there were more than 3 studies involved in the
# meta-analysis, then a variant was filtered out if it was not present in more
# than half of the studies. However, variant that had N >= 0.2 * max(N) were
# kept, even if it didn't pass the threshold for the the number of studies
#
# If there were <= 2 studies involved, only the variants with N >= 0.2 * max(N)
# were kept.
