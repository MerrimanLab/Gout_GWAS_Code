# Scripts in this directory were used to clean up the raw summary stats and make
# it more consistent in terms of required header, chromosome names, etc.

# Once the summary stats were cleaned up to a certain degree, each summary stats
# went through the general QC pipeline for each ancestry.

# These scripts were essentially just for "pre-QC" (prepping summary stats for
# proper QC).

################################################################################

# The pre-QC procedure for each raw summary stats are as follows:

# KP data:
# - Add sample size to each sex/ancestry combinations

bash process_kp.sh

# 23andMe data:
# - clean up some of the original columns
# - calculate MAF using dosage info
#
# NOTE: FILENAME is in the form of "{ancestry}_{cohort}_over17_gout_noNA.dat",
# where ancestry is one of "african_american", "east_asian", "europe", or
# "latino", and cohort is one of "" (blank; for 'full', or combined sex,
# analysis), "male", or "female"

bash 23andMe_clean_data.sh FILENAME

# Japanese data:
# - calculate and add MAF information to the summary stats
# - make the chromosome notation consistent (X into 23)

Rscript add_maf_jap.R

sed 's/X/23/g' data/summary/EAS/jap_illumina_maf.tsv > data/summary/EAS/tmp && mv data/summary/EAS/tmp data/summary/EAS/jap_illumina_maf.tsv
sed 's/X/23/g' data/summary/EAS/jap_japonica_maf.tsv > data/summary/EAS/tmp && mv data/summary/EAS/tmp data/summary/EAS/jap_japonica_maf.tsv

# Chinese data:
# - merge MAF info to the data (sent separately)
# - merge chromosome X data with autosomal data (sent separately)
# - format the male-only data so it can be used with other summary stats during
#   QC and meta-analysis

bash process_chn.sh

# Korean data:
# - clean up header
# - filter relevant columns from the file
# - make the chromosome notation consisteent (X into 23)
# - log the OR

bash clean_korean_data.sh FILENAME

# UKBB data:
# - pull out relevant columns
# - filter for variants with HWE p > 1e-6 and INFO >= 0.3
# - log the OR and convert log10P to P
# NOTE: FILENAME refers to similar convention as with 23andMe, but only for
# cohorts (full, male, or female)

bash process_ukbb.sh FILENAME

# SNPTEST (i.e. GlobalGout, NHS/HPFS, FAST/GenScotland, and Malmo) data:
# - merge chromosome X information to the autosomal data
# - clean up the MAF column from SNPTEST
# - make the chromosome notation consisteent (X into 23)

bash merge_X_snptest.sh FILENAME

# GUGC data:
# - make the chromosome notation consisteent (X into 23)
# - upper case the alleles
# - add MAF information

bash process_gugc.sh data/summary/EUR/GUGC_MetaAnalysis_Results_Gout_snptracker.result

# Partners data:
# - add MAF information and sample size information
# - add CHR/POS information

bash process_partners.sh FILENAME

# FinnGen data:
# - make the chromosome notation consisteent (X into 23)
