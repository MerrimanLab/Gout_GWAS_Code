# Scripts in this directory were used to clean up the processed summary stats
# before running the meta-analysis

################################################################################

# The general QC procedure for the summary stats are as follows:
# - within study, identify and/or remove bad or extreme variants
# - identify and deal with duplicate variants, both within and across studies
# - across studies, check for inconsistent alleles and make the effect allele
#   consistent

################################################################################

# Run per-study QC (in parallel or on its own):
#
# ANC = ancestry (AFR/EUR/EAS/LAT) - where the summary stats are located
# FILE = the filename of the summary stats
Rscript parallel_per_study_qc.R data/summary/ANC/FILE.out

# The above script will:
# - Round sample size to closest integer, generate CHR:POS ID, add "allelic
#   value" and generate MAC column
# - Check for "bad" SNPs and remove them. These include:
#    - non-ACGT alleles
#    - NA or Inf effect size
#    - NA, negative, or Inf SE value
#    - negative MAF or MAF >= 1
#    - SNPs that have sample size less than 0.05 of total sample size for that study
# - Check for SNPs with "extreme" values (but don't remove them):
#    - P-value = 0
#    - absolute effect size > 10
#    - MAF < 0.1%
#    - MAC < 1% of total sample used for that variant

# NOTE: "Allelic value" is a number based on the two alleles (alt and ref) of
# a variant. The "A" allele is given the value of 1, "C" = 2, "G" = 3, and "T"
# = 5, and anything else (such as indel or copy number variation) are given
# some non-sense value like 99. The sum of these two values will be unique and
# will range from 3 to 8, which will allow you to compare variants across
# studies and check whether certain study has the same pair of alleles for that
# particular variant. After making sure the alleles are the same, then you only
# need to check whether the ref or alt allele is the same between the studies
# to determine if the summary stats need to be flipped to keep the effect
# allele consistent across studies.
# Other uses for the allelic value is to determine which allele pair to
# reject/keep for each study, if there are mixture of pairs of alleles in
# multiple studies (e.g. if 2 studies have A/G and 3 studies have A/T). We
# decided to keep the most commonly occuring allele pair (in the above example,
# the A/T pair).

################################################################################

# "Fix" duplicates:
#
# Input files are all of the QCed summary statistics from
# parallel_per_study_qc.R (above).
#
# General purpose of this script is to identify duplicates in each of the input
# summary stats and compare these duplicate variants across studies to make
# sure the "correct" variant is kept for the meta-analysis.
# For example, one study can have duplicated variants, of which one of them
# could be present in all the other studies. In this case, the duplicated
# variant that is not in the other studies should be removed over the one that
# is.
#
# ANC = ancestry (AFR/EUR/EAS/LAT) - where the summary stats are located
# SEX = full, male, or female
Rscript fix_dup.R data/summary/ANC/*_SEX_clean_qc.tsv

# The above script will:
# - remove "easy" duplicates from each study (exact same chr/pos, alleles,
#   summary stats, etc.)
# - for each study, identify variants with duplicated chr/pos with different
#   alleles
# - from all the variants with duplicated chr/pos, figure out which variant
#   should be kept based on how common they are

################################################################################

# Across study QC:
#
# ANC = ancestry (AFR/EUR/EAS/LAT) - where the summary stats are located
# SEX = full, male, or female
Rscript across_study_qc.R data/summary/ANC/*_SEX_clean_qc_nodup.tsv

# The above script will:
# - based on a "reference" summary data (usually the largest sample size and
#   with largest number of variants), define/determine variants to keep and
#   discard those that have different alleles compared to the reference data
#   set
# - check and "flip" the alleles if the variant has an unusually different MAF
#   between the studies
# - remove extreme variants (MAF < 0.01% and absolute effect size > 10)
