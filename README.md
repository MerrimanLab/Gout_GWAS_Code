# Gout_GWAS_Code
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/641473683.svg)](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13350994)

Repository for all the codes written for gout GWAS meta-analysis and all other
analyses that used the meta-analysis results.

## Meta-analysis scripts
Contain all scripts relevant to the QC, single-ancestry and trans-ancestry
meta-analysis.

Summary statistics for AFR, EAS, EUR, LAT, and TAMA are available on GWAS
catalog with the accession IDs GCST90428594-GCST90428605.

Note that these summary statistics do not include the 23andMe data due to prior
data use agreement with 23andMe.

Refer to the relevant README files in the directory.

## Functional analysis scripts
Contain all scripts used for the downstream analyses that used the GWAS summary
statistics from the meta-analysis.

Each analysis is split into separate directory:

- `abc_scripts`
- `chip_scripts`
- `cojo_scripts`
- `colocalisation_scripts`
- `cytokine_qtl`
- `finemapping_scripts`
- `gene_prioritisation`
- `genetic_correlation`
- `heterogeneity`
- `ldsc_scripts`
- `loci_identification`
- `lz_manhattan`
- `magma_scripts`
- `pathway_enrichment`
- `power_calculation`
- `prs_scripts`
- `tfbs_enrichment`
- `variant_annotation`
