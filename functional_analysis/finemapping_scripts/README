# This directory contains all the main scripts used to run finemapping and
# SLALOM

################################################################################

# The general workflow for finemapping:
# 1. Pull out summary statistics of the relevant region
# 2. Generate LD of the regions using UKBB data set
# 3. Run finemapping on the region using the generated LD
# 4. Using the same regions, run SLALOM
# 5. Identify and remove compromised loci from SLALOM

################################################################################
# Pull out loci regions from EUR summary stats

# Make Z-score file for both PAINTOR and FINEMAP:
#
# SEX = full, male, or female
# LOCI_LIST = GWAS loci list from full, male, or female
#
# NOTE: `loci_regions.txt` file generated from this script will/should be used
# in generating LD from UKBB
Rscript generic/make_zfile.R data/fema_data/EUR/EUR_meta_SEX1_clean_rsid.nfiltered.biallelic.txt LOCI_LIST SEX


################################################################################
# Generate LD information for each loci region using the UKBB data set

# Using the `loci_regions.txt` file generated from `generic/make_zfile.R`, pull
# out relevant region from the UKBB data set and calculate the LD
#
# NOTE: the same sample set that was used for the UKBB gout GWAS was used for
# the LD
#
# REGION = second column of `loci_regions.txt` file
# SNP = first column of `loci_regions.txt` file (corresponds to the lead variant)
# SEX = full, male, or female
bash ukbb_ld/calc_ld.sh REGION SNP data/ukbb_ld/SEX/


################################################################################
# Clean the input file for FINEMAP and PAINTOR
#
# The goal of this script is to keep only those variants present in both the
# summary statistics and the UKBB LD, and makes sure the variants are aligned
# to the same allele.
#
# Some other filtering also occurs, such as removing the variant that has MAF
# difference >5% between the summary stats and the UKBB data set.
#
# LD = UKBB .ld file generated for the region
# BIM = as above, but .bim file
# FREQ = as above, but .frq file
# Z_FILE = EUR summary statistics of the region
# PORGRAM = either FINEMAP or PAINTOR
Rscript generic/clean_input.R LD BIM FREQ Z_FILE PROGRAM


################################################################################
# FINEMAP

# NOTE: Need to move/copy the *clean.txt files to *.z files before running the
# script below
#
# SNP = The lead SNP of a locus (it should match the filename)
# SEX = full, male, or female
bash FINEMAP/run_finemap.sh LOCUS SEX

# Pull out relevant info from the FINEMAP results:
#
# DIR = Directory where the FINEMAP outputs are located
# SEX = full, male, or female
# LOCI_LIST = loci list of the EUR GWAS (full/male/female)
Rscript FINEMAP/munge_finemap_results.R DIR SEX LOCI_LIST


################################################################################
# PAINTOR

# For PAINTOR, I ran single causal variant for most loci, but also ran multi
# causal variant version for some that might have multiple signals


# Figure out which annotations to use for PAINTOR.
bash PAINTOR/run_sLDSC_paintor_annot.sh

# Pull out significant annotations:
Rscript PAINTOR/analyse_paintor_annot_res.R

# Determine which annotations are correlated with one another
Rscript PAINTOR/check_annot_corr.R

# Run PAINTOR using the selected annotations
bash PAINTOR/run_paintor.sh

# Summarise the PAINTOR results
#
# DIR = directory where the PAINTOR results are
# SEX = full, male, or female
Rscript PAINTOR/munge_paintor_results.R DIR SEX


################################################################################
# TAMA BF

# Run the logBF finemapping method on the TAMA GWAS results.
#
# The regions are defined in the same way as in the EUR loci regions.
#
# NOTE: This method is only done on the TAMA loci
#
# DATA = TAMA GWAS results (full/male/female)
# SEX = full, male, or female
# LOCI_LIST = loci list of the TAMA GWAS (full/male/female)
Rscript TAMA_BF/tama_credible_set.R DATA SEX LOCI_LIST


################################################################################
# SLALOM

# Some scripts needed to be altered from the original SLALOM paper:
SLALOM/import_cup_files.py
SLALOM/slalom.py

# Prepare the summary stats for SLALOM
bash SLALOM/prep_slalom.sh
bash SLALOM/prep_slalom.tama.sh

# Run SLALOM on the loci that were finemapped
#
# DATA = summary stats used for finemapping, formatted for SLALOM
# OUT_DIR = where to output the SLALOM result
bash SLALOM/run_slalom.sh DATA OUT_DIR
bash SLALOM/run_slalom.tama.sh DATA OUT_DIR

# Read in SLALOM results and determine which loci were suspicious
#
# OUT_DIR = where the SLALOM results are
Rscript SLALOM/process_slalom_result.R OUT_DIR

# Combine all of the finemapping results into a single file
