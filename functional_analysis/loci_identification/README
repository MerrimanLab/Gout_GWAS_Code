# Gout loci identification

# Gout loci were identified and listed up by Ruth and Tanya, and this process
# have gone through MANY iterations. This process was both manual and
# automated/scripted.

# First, Ruth generated a list of loci based on the neighbouring significant
# variants using GenomicRanges (checking for continuous significant variants
# within +/-50kb). See the file below:

gout_loci/Part1_making_tables.R

# Next, Tanya used this list to clump and check for LD between the lead
# variants at different regions:

gout_loci/clumping_process.Rmd

# Urate loci identification

# Urate loci were (crudely) identified by Riku, recreating the method mentioned
# in our paper. The general methodology should be identical as above, although
# things may have been done slightly differently.

# Generate a file of Tin + UKBB urate meta analysis result with adjusted P so
# that the clumping doesn't miss the extremely significant variants
Rscript urate_loci/scale_p.R

# Generate a crude loci list:
Rscript urate_loci/pre_clump.R

# In parallel, clump each urate locus region
#
# Note that each region was saved separately in the previous script
parallel --xapply -j10 bash src/clump/loci_clump.sh dat/urate_clumping/{1}.txt {2} ::: $(cut -f7 dat/urate_clumping/crude_clumping.txt) ::: $(cut -f8 dat/urate_clumping/crude_clumping.txt)

# Check the clump results and make sure the lead variant in each clump/region
# is the same as the input lead variant, since the lead variant may be missing
# in the 1000 Genomes data sometimes
Rscript urate_loci/post_clump.check.R

# Plot LZ for the clumps that didn't have the matching lead variant and make
# sure the clump lead wasn't too far away/completely wrong
Rscript urate_loci/plot_lz.no_match.R

# Calculate the LD between the lead variants of clumps:
bash urate_loci/get_cross_loci_ld.sh

# Merge clumps/regions that have high enough LD (and (re)clump the merged region)
Rscript urate_loci/check_cross_loci_ld.R
Rscript urate_loci/reclump_check.R

# Note: these urate loci are not "complete" like our gout loci, since I haven't
# identified all the different signals within locus.
