# Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) enrichment analysis

# This analysis was done to see if any of the cpg sites that showed colocalised
# meQTL with the gout GWAS. In other words, when a gout variant had evidence of
# altering the methylation level of a cpg site, was there any enrichment of TFs
# that bound to the area surrounding the cpg site?
#
# TF information was taken from the RELI (ChIP-seq) data set.
#
# A simple contingency table was generate for each TF in question, comparing
# the number of TF bound to the cpg sites that were colocalised or not (i.e. TF
# binding/not binding vs. cpg colocalised/not colocalised).

# Pull out all cpg sites available from the GoDMC data - enrichment will be
# assesed by comparing the TF binding with this baseline:
bash get_godmc_cpg.sh

# Run the enrichment analysis for all of the TFs
Rscript tfbs_fisher.R
