# This directory contains the scripts for our gene prioritisation using
# gene-function and function-agnostic criteria

################################################################################

# The gene prioritisation was done by overlapping seven criteria:
# 1. Having an eQTL co-localized with GWAS signal in whole blood
# 2. Having an eQTL in monocytes (ImmuNexUT or OneK1K datasets)
# 3. Within a locus with a co-localized meQTL
# 4. Within a locus with gout association signal that also genetically
#    associates with one or more of 36 blood cell traits (using phenoscanner
#    in R to query the PhenoScanner database)
# 5. Differentially expressed in gout
# 6. Expressed in GTEx whole blood tissue as >0.1 average transcript per million
# 7. Differentially expressed in monocytes stimulated with MSU crystals and/or
#    lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (LPS vs MSU crystal, LPS vs phosphate-buffered
#    saline control, MSU crystal vs PBS control)
#
# And then scored again based on three criteria:
# 1. One of 47 genes containing a strong candidate missense causal variant
# 2. One of the 385 target genes of the activity-by-contact enhancer
# 3. Gene with FANTOM5 transcription start site (TSS) closest to the lead SNP
